The solution to Metro bundler errors varies greatly depending on the specific error message and your project setup.  However, common troubleshooting steps include:

1. **Check your package.json:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and compatible with Expo's version.
2. **Clean and rebuild:** Run `expo start --clear` to clean the cache and force a rebuild.
3. **Update dependencies:** Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update all packages to their latest versions.
4. **Examine error messages:** Carefully analyze the error message from the Metro bundler for clues about the cause. Look for specific module errors or conflicts.
5. **Check for conflicting packages:** Check your package.json for conflicts between dependencies.  Use tools like `npm-check-updates` to help identify outdated packages.
6. **Inspect native modules:** If integrating native modules, ensure they're properly configured and linked. Follow the module's documentation precisely.
7. **Restart the Metro bundler:** If all else fails, try restarting your development server.

Example (bugSolution.js):  This example assumes the bug was caused by a missing or incorrect dependency.  This solution illustrates how to install a missing package.

npm install --save react-native-vector-icons

This example in bugSolution.js corrects a dependency error. In a real-world scenario, the solution would depend heavily on the nature of the error you encountered.
